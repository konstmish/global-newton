# Regularized Newton Method

This repository contains the code used for paper "Regularized Newton Method with Global $O(1/k^2)$ Convergence". The .py and .ipynb files contain exactly the same code that runs two experiments and saves the results in the folder. The notebook (.ipynb) also contains the resulting plots. You can also see and run the code online through [this Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-LmO57VfJ1-AYMopMPYbkFvKBF7YNhW2?usp=sharing).
